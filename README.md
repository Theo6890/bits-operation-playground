# <h1 align="center"> Bitwise Operations Playground </h1>

This repo is a playground to understand and to manipulate bits in Solidity. AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR & shifts (left & right) will not have any secret once completed.

We will look at libraries like: solidstate-contracts and solmate who both uses bitwise operations, e.g. to pack data with shifts and extract values with masks.

# Operations

1.  AND: `&`
2.  OR: `|`
3.  Shifts: left shift `<<`, right shift `>>`
4.  XOR: `^`
5.  NOT: `~`
6.  NAND: ~(`a & b`)
7.  NOR: ~(`a | b`)
